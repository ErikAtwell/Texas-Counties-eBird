In Texas, there is a fun challenge for birders called the Century club, in which a birder must observe 100 species in 100 different counties. 

The idea behind this app is that a user can input their personal eBird data, pick a certain Texas county, and compute how many species they would have a chance at seeing during any week of the year. 
This helps them figure out which week(s) of the year would net them the most new county birds for their list.

Using formulas on excel, someone in the Texas birding community had put together a version of this in which the user copies and pastes their data for that specific county.
In this version, the user just has to upload their saved ebird data and select a county.
